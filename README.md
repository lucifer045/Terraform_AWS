# AWS + Terraform Projects Repository

Welcome to my **AWS + Terraform Projects** repository.  
This repository is a growing collection of hands-on Terraform projects for building and managing **AWS cloud infrastructure**. Each project is designed to demonstrate real-world cloud and DevOps practices using Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
